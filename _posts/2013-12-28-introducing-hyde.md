My most [recent paper has been published in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-17-0101.1). It looks at the ways that 5-day rotational atmospheric normal modes modulate tropical convection (zonal wind anomalies affecting upslope flow, convergence forced by topography, anomalous moisture transports, and maybe affecting surface evaporation).

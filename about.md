Hi! I'm currently a research fellow at Monash University, working on issues relating to tropical convection in the Indian Ocean.

Before this, I completed a PhD at the University of Melbourne on interactions between a global-mode wave and tropical convection, worked in financial statistics for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and did an PhB in physics at the ANU in Canberra, where I worked with a lot of lasers.

Also the co-owner of a cute greyhound and way too much nerdy stuff.
